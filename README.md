# WEBMARIZER

![](https://i.imgur.com/Tx7lLVa.png)

WEBMARIZER is a GUI wrapper for FFmpeg and FFprobe. It automatically 'summarizes' a video by creating a series of WEBMs from videos at even intervals within the video. This is similar to a video thumbnails sheet but in WEBM form. Videos must be located in same folder that create.py (or the executable) resides.
